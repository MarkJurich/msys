/*****
 *
 * The following are MinGW specific extensions to the POSIX standard;
 * they provide a mechanism for using the `flags' argument to `catopen'
 * to increase the allocation size of the catalogue descriptor table by
 * more than a single slot, when it must be expanded.
 *
 * To utilise this extension, say to allocate a 5-slot descriptor table,
 * `catopen()' should be called as:
 *
 *    nl_catd catd;
 *    catd = catopen( "catname", NL_CATD_BLKSIZ( 5 ));
 *
 * or:
 *
 *    nl_catd catd;
 *    catd = catopen( "catname", NL_CAT_LOCALE | NL_CATD_BLKSIZ( 5 ));
 *
 * Note that using this extension is strictly non-portable; the maximum
 * block size which may be specified is NL_CATD_BLKSIZ( 127 ).
