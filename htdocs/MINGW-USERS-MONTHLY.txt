What is MinGW?
==============

MinGW stands for "Minimalist GNU for Windows" and is development
package (as well as target) which allows to compile software for
"native" Windows 32-bit platforms. Please visit http://www.mingw.org 
for more information.

Who is author of MinGW? How is it maintained? What is licensing?
================================================================

MinGW was created by Colin Peters and put by him in public domain.
There is no centralized force behind MinGW - it is maintained by
volunteers and its development directed by the user community.
MinGW uses free GNU C/C++ compiler, its core libraries/headers are
in public domain and it uses vendor-supplied runtime library, so
in short, you can use it to develop royalty-free software, either
open- or close-sourced. For more comprehensive licensing terms,
please visit http://www.mingw.org/licensing.shtml

Can MinGW be used to compile GNU or OpenSource software? MSVC one?
==================================================================

MinGW runtime library adheres to ANSI C standard and offers some bits
of POSIX compatibility, so many software packages can be compiled with
little or no changes. However, most GNU software (and OpenSource
sofware in general) nowadays uses GNU configure-based build procedure,
which cannot be handled by MinGW directly. The solution is to
cross-compile to MinGW from more complete environment.

MinGW was specifically created to allow "native" (read: MSVC-hosted)
source to be compiled with GCC. Most projects compile without any
changes. Still, some changes to build procedure may be required.
Tools for automated conversion of MSVC projects exist.

Support
=======

MinGW's web site is http://www.mingw.org . There, you can find
general information, download and installation instructions,
links to ported software, FAQ, history and news, etc. MinGW
mailing list (http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/mingw-users)
is a place to aks questions, discuss MinGW-related issues and
announce availability of software. Before posting questions,
please make sure that it is not covered in comprehnsive FAQ
(http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml). Searching mailing
list archives may be laso helpful (archives accessible from
the mailing list homepage).

Reporting bugs and contributing
===============================

MinGW existence and development is impossible without community
attention and contribution. Please submit bugreports via
this link: http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=2435 
(if you are registered SourceForge user, please submit when you are
logged in). Submit patches for MinGW runtime/tools, corrections and
additions for the web pages via
http://sourceforge.net/patch/?func=addpatch&group_id=2435 .
