<h1>MinGW - Reporting Bugs</h1>
  <p>So you think you have found a bug and want to
  report the problem? Before reporting a bug
  please ensure you have applied all applicable
  updates to your build environment. Also please
  search the MinGW archives to ensure the bug has
  not already been reported or if a temporary
  work around has been generated.&nbsp; When
  reporting a bug to the MinGW mailing list
  please include the following information:</p>
   
  <ul>
    <li>OS version ( Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP )</li>
    <li>gcc version ( `gcc -v` )</li>
    <li>ld version ( `ld -v` )</li>
    <li>mingw version ( name of installer package eg/ MinGW-2.0.0-3.exe )</li>
    <li>build environment ( MSYS, Cygwin, Cross-Compiler, etc )</li>
    <li>if using MSYS version number ( `uname -a`)</li>
    <li>small test case demonstrating the bug<span class="underline">OR</span></li>
    <li>MSDN documentation references for missing w32api or mingw-runtime features</li>
    <li>mingw-runtime version ( include/_mingw.h)</li>
    <li>w32api version ( include/w32api.h )</li>
    <li>any other detailed information pertinent to your experience with the bug</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SourceForge gives us nice tools to keep track of your bug reports, so please
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2435&amp;atid=102435">follow this link to file your
      report.</a> You will need a SourceForge
      login account. If you don't have one then
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">follow
      this link to register for one.</a>
  </p>
  <p><span class="bold">Generic Package Bugs</span></p>
  <p>Under certain circumstances you may find a bug
  in a base package, such as gcc, that is
  platform independent (ie/ can be reproduced on
  another platform other than Win32).&nbsp; In
  this situation please generate a simple test
  case that illustrates the bug using only
  standard headers and libraries.&nbsp; Please
  submit the bug following the procedure detailed
  above <span class="underline">prior</span> to
  submiting it to the primary maintainers. After
  receiving verification from a MinGW developer
  that the bug is indeed platform independent,
  please use the appropriate bug tracker or
  mailing list to inform the package
  maintainers.&nbsp; It is in everyones best
  interest that you try and use the package
  maintainers standard methods and procedures for
  bug submission.&nbsp; Avoid submiting bugs
  specific to a port or application that is not a
  part of the primary package to any list except
  the MinGW users list.&nbsp; If you are
  uncertain about bug submission to another
  package maintainer seek assistance on the MinGW
  users list.
