            <h2>Downloading MinGW</h2>
            <p> Development of MinGW is done within a framework of
inter-related <i>packages</i>.  There is a package for the MinGW
runtime, packages             for GCC and other tool ports, a package
for the w32api, and so forth.             All of these packages conform
to a set of common conventions (internal layout, directory
structure, naming scheme).             The traditional method for
installing MinGW was to create a directory for the installation,
download the desired individual packages, and extract their
contents into the installation directory (the common  internal layout
shared by the packages made this possible). </p>
            <p> However, in mid-2001 the team began publishing a
single-archive "MinGW distribution"... bundling the latest versions of
all individual             packages available at the time of release. 
This was done partially to             streamline the installation
process for newbies, and partially to             help application and
library developers design products that will build using MinGW
(previously MinGW was a moving target with all the constant updates to
individual packages, but now it is easier to verify things as being
"MinGW 1.0 compatible"). </p>
            <p> The individual packages making up the MinGW distribution
are still             produced and made available for download
seperately. Updated versions of             individual packages will
sometimes be made available in between releases             of the main
MinGW distribution... in most cases it should be possible to
extract a package's content into your MinGW directory to take advantage
of the updates immediately. </p>
            <h3>Download location</h3>
            <p> The standard MinGW download page is hosted by <a
 target="_nw"
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435">
SourceForge</a>.  This page contains the latest version of the main
MinGW distribution archive, as well as all available pacakges files to
download.<br>

            <h3>Downloading the distribution</h3>
            <p> The naming scheme for the main MinGW distribution file
is: </p>
            <blockquote> <tt>
Mingw-&lt;version&gt;[-&lt;stamp&gt;].&lt;tar.gz or zip&gt; </tt> </blockquote>
Where:
            <dl>
              <dt> <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> </dt>
              <dd> Arbitrarily chosen by the MinGW development team, the
latest version at the                   time of this writing was 1.0.1. 
Major updates to the distribution will involve
incrementing the most-significant digit in the version number,  smaller
updates will increment less-significant digits. </dd>
              <dt> <tt>&lt;stamp&gt;</tt> </dt>
              <dd> Always YYYYMMDD format, representing the date on
which the distribution                   was bundled (not related to the
timestamp or version of any component                   package. </dd>
              <dt> <tt>&lt;suffix&gt;</tt> </dt>
              <dd> File extension corresponding to the compression
method used. We are using <tt>zip</tt> and/or <tt>tar.gz</tt>.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>Downloading packages</h3>
            <p> All the MinGW releases use consistent naming scheme: </p>
            <blockquote> <tt>
&lt;package_name&gt;-&lt;original_version&gt;[-&lt;stamp&gt;].&lt;suffix&gt; </tt> </blockquote>
Where:
            <dl>
              <dt> <tt>&lt;package_name&gt;</tt> </dt>
              <dd> Package name of this release. Package name is usually
obtained from                   the official short software name. </dd>
              <dt> <tt>&lt;original_version&gt;</tt> </dt>
              <dd> Official software vesrion. Since most of MinGW
packages is official GNU                   software, we don't control
this field and take it as is from documentation                   or
specification files. </dd>
              <dt> <tt>&lt;stamp&gt;</tt> </dt>
              <dd> Stamp is:
                <ul>
                  <li> Always YYYYMMDD timestamp for non-production
releases (i.e. alpha                         and beta releases). </li>
                  <li> Sequental integer (release number) for official
releases of ported                         software (i.e.  software
which we do not maintain). </li>
                  <li> May not be present for our own packages (we
increment version for them,                         not release number). </li>
                </ul>
              </dd>
              <dt> <tt>&lt;suffix&gt;</tt> </dt>
              <dd> File extension corresponding to the compression
method used. We are using <tt>zip</tt> and/or <tt>tar.gz</tt>.</dd>
            </dl>
For example, <tt>binutils-2.10.91-20001205.zip</tt> is a binutils
(which are GNU Binary Utilities) 2.10.91 alpha or beta release made
on 5th of December, 2000.

            <h2>Installing MinGW</h2>
            <p> The recommended method of installation for beginners
involves downloading the             latest version of the single-file
distribution, rather than any individual             packages. </p>
            <p> After downloading the archive, create a directory on
your system that you wish             to serve as the base of the
installation (i.e. <tt>C:\MINGW</tt>).  Extract the
distribution archive into this directory.  If your
compression/extraction application does not by default preserve the
directory structure of             archive contents, be sure that you
instruct it to do so manually. </p>
            <p> The last step is to add the <tt>/bin</tt> subdirectory
of MinGW installation to             your PATH (the procedure for doing
this varies based on the operating system             version you are
using). Remember to place MinGW ahead of Cygwin in your PATH if
applicable (see the <a href="mingwfaq.shtml#faq-usingwithcygwin">FAQ</a>
for more detail). </p>
            <p> To verify that installation completed properly, run "<tt>gcc
-v</tt>". You             should see output close to the following: </p>
            <pre>   Reading specs from c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc-lib/mingw32/2.95.3-5/specs<br>            </pre>
(Note that your base installation directory may differ)<!--                            End of Main Body                             --> </td>
