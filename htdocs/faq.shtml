<h2>
Downloading MinGW
</h2>
<p>
MinGW is distributed as a set of inter-related <i>packages</i>. By package
we mean self-dependent (in the bounds specified by criteria below) 
software distribution, conforming to common conventions (such as the
internal layout, naming scheme (and generally, package meta-information
scheme), installation procedure). Distributing MinGW this way is beneficial
both for MinGW maintainers and permanent users - maintainers can spend less
time for background work (laying out files, writing installation
readme's, transferring files), and devote more time to such things as
development, staying current with latest developments (remember, core
of MinGW is GNU packages developed in collaborative way), and quick bugs
turnaround. From the other side, users can make use of this flexible
maintanance scheme by deciding themselves what and when they install or
upgrade. Of course new users may be overwhelmed with this possibilities
- that's why this document is written.

</p>

<h3>
Download location
</h3>
<p>
Standard MinGW download page is
<a target="_nw" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&release_id=15084">
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&release_id=15084</a>.
This page lists all available MinGW pacakges, their releases, and specific
files to download. Also (and most importantly), it gives access to
<i><b>Release Notes</b></i> and <i><b>ChangeLog</b></i> for specific release.
Both items are your first guides in questions <i>"What this package is?"</i>
and <i>"What is new in this release?"</i>. Moreover, in some cases it's
the only documentation available for the package (at least, for MinGW port).
So, it is <i>highly</i> recommended to read these notes before downloading.
Unfortunately, we didn't yet come to consistent format and content of
notes and ChangeLog, but you still may find important information this way,
for example, that specific release is alpha (and hence not intended for
general use), or that some package depends on another (i.e., both should
be installed before they will work).
</p>

<p>
With this warning in mind, here's direct link leading to download directory:
<a target="_nw" href="http://download.sourceforge.net/mingw/">
http://download.sourceforge.net/mingw/</a> (HTTP), 
<a target="_nw" href="ftp://download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/mingw/">
ftp://download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/mingw/</a> (FTP).

</p>

<h3>
Downloading packages
</h3>
<p>
All the MinGW releases use consistent naming scheme:
<blockquote>
<tt>
&lt;package_name&gt;-&lt;original_version&gt;[-&lt;stamp&gt;].&lt;suffix&gt;
</tt>
</blockquote>
Where:
<dl>

<dt>
<tt>&lt;package_name&gt;</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
Package name of this release. Package name is usually obtained from
the official short software name.
</dd>

<dt>
<tt>&lt;original_version&gt;</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
Official software vesrion. Since most of MinGW packages is official GNU
software, we don't control this field and take it as is from documentation
or specification files.
</dd>

<dt>
<tt>&lt;stamp&gt;</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
Stamp is:
<ul>
<li>Always YYYYMMDD timestamp for non-production releases (i.e. alpha
and beta releases).
<li>Sequental integer (release number) for official releases of ported
software (i.e.
software which we do not maintain).
<li>May not be present for our own packages (we increment version for them,
not release number).
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>
<tt>&lt;suffix&gt;</tt>
</dt>
<dd>
File suffix (extension) corresponding to used packer. We are using either
<tt>zip</tt> or <tt>tar.gz</tt> methods.
</dd>

</dl>
For example, <tt>binutils-2.10.91-20001205.zip</tt> is a binutils
(which are GNU Binary Utilities) 2.10.91 alpha or beta release made
on 5th of December, 2000.

<h2>
Installing MinGW
</h2>

<h3>
Installing packages
</h3>
<p>
After you have downloaded packages you decided to install
(following packages are mandatory:
<tt>libbfd</tt>, <tt>binutils</tt>, <tt>ld</tt>, <tt>gcc</tt>,
<tt>w32api</tt>, <tt>mingw-runtime</tt>), you should choose installation
directory (<i>recommended</i> location is <tt>/mingw</tt> (which means
top-level directory "<tt>mingw</tt>" on your usual development drive,
something like <tt>e:\mingw</tt> in legacy DOS notation)), you should install
packages by simply unpacking them into that directory.
</p>
<p>
The last step is to add <tt>bin</tt> subdirectory of MinGW installation to
your PATH (you should use DOS notation there!). The easiest way to achieve
this is to create MinGW startup file, e.g. <tt>rc.mingw.bat</tt> and put
there commands:
<blockquote>
<tt>
PATH e:\mingw\bin;%PATH%<br>
command.com
</tt>
</blockquote>
(replace <tt>command.com</tt> with your favorite shell).
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, you can start your MinGW session by starting
<tt>rc.mingw.bat</tt>.
</p>

<h3>
Verifying installation
</h3>
<p>
To verify that installation completed properly, run "<tt>gcc -v</tt>". You
should see output close to the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Reading specs from e:\mingw\bin\..\lib\gcc-lib\mingw32\2.95.2\specs
gcc driver version 2.95.2 19991024 (release) executing gcc version 2.95.2-mingw
snapshot 20001214
</pre>
</blockquote>
(Note that actual snapshot timestamp may differ)
