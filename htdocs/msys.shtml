            MSYS was created out of a long-lived desire to provide the MinGW community a
            Minimal SYStem, with which a configure script could be executed.  This is finally 
            available from the 
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435">MinGW download area</a> on SourceForge.
         </p>
         <p>
            Most users will need only the binary distribution of MSYS, which is provided
            as a Windows installer executable. MSYS versions prior to 1.0.8 are available
            for three processor architectures:
         </p>
         <p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>i386</b>, which will run on any 32-bit Intel-compatible processor.</li>
               <li><b>i586</b>, which will run on Pentium processors or newer (and compatibles).</li>
               <li><b>i686</b>, which will run on Pentium Pro, Pentium II and Celeron processors or newer
                  (and compatibles).
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            MSYS versions 1.0.8 and later include only the i386 binary distribution, which will run
            on any 32-bit Intel-compatible processor.
            The tarball flagged as &quot;src&quot; contains the source code for MSYS, which is unnecessary unless a 
            manual build is desired. Source tarballs may not be provided for snapshots and
            prereleases, so the latest source should be obtained from the &quot;msys&quot; module in
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=2435">MinGW CVS</a>.
            The files flagged as &quot;odmp&quot; and &quot;perdr&quot;
            are used to diagnose problems in MSYS itself, and are only useful for MSYS developers.
         </p>

            More information about using MinGW with 
            MSYS can be found in the <a href="mingwfaq.shtml#faq-usingwithmsys">FAQ</a>, 
            and the current MSYS documentation can be found in the &quot;\msys\1.0\doc\msys&quot; 
            subdirectory within the binary distribution.
         </p>
         <p>
            There is also a new mailing list for MSYS discussion (MinGW-msys).  See the 
            <a href="lists.shtml">Mailing Lists</a> page for more information and access to this list.
