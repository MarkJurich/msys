      <h1>MinGW - Minimal SYStem</h1>

      <p>MSYS was created out of a long-lived desire to provide the MinGW
      community a Minimal SYStem, with which a configure script could be
      executed. This is finally available from the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435">MinGW
      download area</a> on SourceForge.</p>

      <p>MSYS versions 1.0.8 and later include only the i386 binary
      distribution, which will run on any 32-bit Intel-compatible processor.
      The tarball flagged as "src" contains the source code for MSYS runtime
      and each package used to provide executable binaries, which is
      unnecessary unless a manual build is desired. Source tarballs may not
      be provided for snapshots and prereleases, so the latest source should
      be obtained from the "msys/rt" and "msys/packages" modules in <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=2435">MinGW CVS</a>. The files
      ending in "odmp" and "perdr" are used to diagnose the a stackdump
      should that occur.</p>

      <p>More information about using MinGW with MSYS can be found in the <a
      href="mingwfaq.shtml#faq-usingwithmsys">FAQ</a>, and the current MSYS
      documentation can be found in the "\msys\1.0\doc\msys" subdirectory
      within the binary distribution.</p>

      <p>There is also a mailing list for MSYS discussion (MinGW-msys). See
      the <a href="lists.shtml">Mailing Lists</a> page for more information
      and access to this list.</p>
