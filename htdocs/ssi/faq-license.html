  <h3>MinGW licensing?</h3>
  <p>When Colin Peters released the MinGW runtime he placed the source into the
  public domain.  No one owns a copyright (C) to the source because of this.
  You as a software manufacturer are free to use the MinGW runtime in your
  proprietary and OpenSource software as you see fit.  The only thing you can't
  do is to claim ownership of the source and use Colin Peters' name, the MinGW
  name or the name of any of it's contributors in endorsement of any product.

  <p>For those interested in the actual legal details and technical
  points regarding copyright of the mingw compiler system, copyright
  information is included in the headers and the source files of the
  compiler distribution package.
  The following also applies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The mingw basic runtime system, which is basically the glue
    to the underlying operating system, is completely in the public
    domain.  The runtime system includes mingw headers (such as stdio.h),
    libraries (such as libmingw32.a) and import libraries for
    CRTDLL/MSVCRT.
    </li>
    <li>W32API, which consists of the headers and import libraries related to
    WIN32 API access, is released under
    <a href="http://www.acc.umu.se/%7Eanorland/gnu-win32/README.w32api">
    copyright</a>.  The copyright agreement states no restrictions are
    placed on programs or object files compiled with the library.  There are
    restrictions if you wish to distribute the library as part of another
    package.
    </li>
    <li>Mingw development tools, which include compilers, linkers, other
    tools in the bin directory, etc., are released under the
    GNU General Public License.
    </li>
    <li>Profiled code, which is code compiled and linked with the
    <code>-pg</code> option for runtime
    profiling, also falls under the GNU General Public License.
    </li>
