  <h3>What happened to the old FAQ?</h3>
  <p>
     The old FAQ is full of lots of good information.  Eventually that
     information will be distributed to other places within
     <a href="http://www.mingw.org">www.mingw.org</a>.  In the mean time you
     can reference it from by <a href="mingw-oldfaq.shtml">clicking here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
     Basically a decision was made to shorten the FAQ.  Although the old FAQ
     provided a good source of information we felt that it was hard to maintain.
     We have therefore provided you with this document to replace it in the
     hopes of providing better service.  If you feel that anything is missing
     please say so in the <a href="mailto:mingw-users@lists.sourceforge.net">
     MinGW-users</a> mail list.
