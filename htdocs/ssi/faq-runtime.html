  <h3>Which runtime should I use?</h3>
  <p>MinGW requires you to have the Microsoft runtime library MSVCRT.DLL on your
  system.  Support for CRTDLL.DLL is no longer being maintained.  The CRTDLL
  legacy code will remain for some time but will not be guaranteed to be present
  in future releases.  The only problem you may have is that if you try to use
  a program built with MSVCRT.DLL on a Windows 95 Release 1 system.  On these
  systems the MSVCRT.DLL wasn't present, however, it is freely available from
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_nw">http://www.microsoft.com</a>.
