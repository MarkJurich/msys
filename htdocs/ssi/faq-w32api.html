  <h3>What is w32api?</h3>
  <p>
     The w32api is the package of headers and import libraries to support the
     win32 Application Programming Interface as created by Microsoft.  The MinGW
     development team are the current maintainers of the w32api since without
     that package Windows Programming would not be possible.  The package was
     created by Anders Norlander and it's license is also non-restrictive.  For
     more information see Anders' README file 
     <a href="http://www.acc.umu.se/%7Eanorland/gnu-win32/README.w32api" 
     target="_nw"> README.w32api</a>.  The current version of the w32api 
     package is 0.4 and can be found at <a href=
     "http://download.sourceforge.net/mingw/" target="_nw">
