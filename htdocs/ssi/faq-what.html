  <h3>What is MinGW?</h3>
  <p>
     MinGW is an acronym for "Minimalist GNU for Windows".  The name was coined
     by Colin Peters who created headers and import definitions for Microsoft's
     crtdll C runtime in an effort to remove the dependancy of the Cygwin1.dll
     from applications built by Cygwin's GCC.  Colin maintains a website about
     MinGW at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/6162/gcc.html" target="_nw">
     http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/6162/gcc.html</a> which lists some
     interesting details you won't find here.  Other history details can be

     Today MinGW is a project of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">SourceForge.net</a>.
     We have a few developers working on their spare time with no corporate
     funding in the project.  If you would like to volunteer please let us know
     via email to the <a href="mailto:mingw-users@sourceforge.net">MinGW mail list</a>
