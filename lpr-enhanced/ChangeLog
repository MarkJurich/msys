	lpr-enhanced-1.0.2 released.

2009-09-15  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Make `install' / `uninstall' procedures more robust.

	* Makefile.in (install-lpr-basic): Check for `lpr-basic.exe' as a
	symbolic link; don't leave it dangling.  Otherwise, don't overwrite it
	if both it and `lpr.exe' exist; instead use `lpr-orig.exe' as backup
	name for `lpr.exe', overwriting this alternative if required.
	(install-lpr-enhanced): Don't clobber `${sysconfdir}/printcap' if it
	is already present; don't ever include it in...
	(bindist): ...this.
	(uninstall): Correct syntactical misuse of `test rmdir ...'.
	Don't remove `${sysconfdir}/printcap', if it differs from the copy
	installed as `${localstatedir}/spool/lp/config.example'; reflect
	backup name changes applied in `install-lpr-basic'.

2009-09-15  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Reorganise file assignment to documentation / licence distributions.

	* Makefile.in (DOC_DISTFILES): Add `AUTHORS', removing it from...
	(LIC_DISTFILES): ...this.

2009-09-15  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in (bindist, docdist, licdist): Construct distribution
	tarballs directly, so eliminating...
	(bindist-recursive, docdist-recursive, licdist-recursive): ...these
	redundantly recursive goals respectively; remove them.

2009-09-14  Charles Wilson  <mingw@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	* Makefile.in (bindist-recursive): Explicitly set `localstatedir' and
	`sysconfdir' for staged installation.
