README for lpr-1.0.1-MSYS
=========================

Hereby donated to the public domain.

This package provides a rudimentary emulation of a UNIX System-V `lp', or BSD
`lpr' command line interface to a MS-Windows print spooler; it is suitable for
use with MSYS or with Cygwin.

This is free software.  There is no warranty of any kind, not even any implied
warranty of merchantibility, nor of fitness for any particular purpose; the
author will, at no time, accept liability for damage of any kind, however
caused, resulting from the use of this software.

To install this software, simply extract the tarball into the root of your
MSYS or Cygwin directory tree, and copy or link the `/usr/spool/lp/bin/lpr'
script to `/usr/bin/lp' and/or to `/usr/bin/lpr'.  You will also need to
create a `/etc/printcap' file, based on `/usr/spool/lp/config/example', and
adjusted to suit your printer spool configuration; (if your system supports
file linking, you may also choose to keep a linked copy of `/etc/printcap' in
`/usr/spool/lp/config/.active', or on any system, to use this as a exclusive
alternative configuration file).

Usage instructions are included, as comments, within the `lpr' script itself.
