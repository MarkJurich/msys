	WinPOSIX bug fixes and API enhancements.

	* src/winposix (win32posix): Function renamed...
	(win32path_transform): ...to this.
	(win32path_is_absolute): New function; it checks if a specified Win32
	path name is absolute.

	* src/compat.h (isabspath): Macro renamed...
	(IS_ABSOLUTE_PATH): ...to this.
	(POSIX_STYLE_PATH): New macro; use it to invoke the
	win32path_transform function, when required.
	(PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR): Fix it, for non-Win32 hosts; had ';',
	should be ':'.

	* src/manpath.c: Use POSIX_STYLE_PATH and IS_ABSOLUTE_PATH macros.

	* src/util.c: Use POSIX_STYLE_PATH macro.

2005-06-03  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* man2html/Makefile.in (top_builddir): New identifier; have autoconf
	supply its value.
	(CWARN): New identifier; define it as the warning flags, which were
	previously included in CFLAGS.
	(CFLAGS): Redefined; include $(CWARN), add -I$(top_builddir)/src
	(man2html): Make it depend on $(top_builddir)/src/version.h, rather
	than ../src/version.h.
	(hman): Locate hman.sh in $(srcdir).

	* man2html/man2html.c (version.h): Don't specify path.

2005-06-03  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Set package versioning from configure.ac.

	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Supply PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION
	parameter values; PACKAGE_NAME=man, PACKAGE_VALUE=1.5m3.

	* configure: Regenerated.

	* version: Redundant file; removed.

	* src/Makefile.in (package, version): New identifiers; initialise them
	from PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION respectively.
	(version.h): Make it depend on configure.ac; insert $(version).
	(apropos, whatis, makewhatis): Identify as $(package)-$(version).

	* src/man.conf.in: Identify as PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.

	* man2html/Makefile.in (package, version): New identifiers; initialise
	them from PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION.
	(hman): Identify as $(package)-$(version).
	(VPATH): Defined to autoconf specified $(srcdir).

2005-06-02  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Make code in src directory compile on Win32/MinGW platform.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): add src/man.conf.

	* configure: Regenerated.

	* src/Makefile.in (apropos.sh): Use $(srcdir) to find it.

	* src/compat.h: New file; it defines platform specific dependencies
	for use within C compilation units.

	* src/makemsg.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, unistd.h, string.h): Include conditionally.

	* src/man.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(locale.h, stdlib.h, string.h, sys/file.h, sys/stat.h, unistd.h):
	Previously included unconditionally; make them conditional.
	(strings.h): Include conditionally, unless we already have string.h.
	(GREPSILENT): Change from single character definition to string;
	format it using "%s".  (Rationale: UNIX SysV grep can't use -q or -s
	to suppress output; must redirect to null device stream).
	(setlocale): Some platforms don't define LC_MESSAGES; don't use it
	when we don't have it.  Similarly for LC_CTYPE.

	* src/manpath.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, string.h, sys/types.h, sys/stat.h, unistd.h): Previously
	included unconditionally; make them conditional.
	(split, split2): Use win32posix() function to ensure that Win32 path
	names include only slashes, and no backslashes;
	Use PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR, defined in compat.h, to locate point at which
	to split a path list; previously these assumed splitting at a colon.
	(add_to_list): Use isabspath(dir) macro, defined in compat.h, to check
	if dir is specified with absolute path name; previously required first
	character to be a slash.

	* src/man-config.c, src/to_cat.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, string.h): Include conditionally; were previously included
	unconditionally.

	* src/man-getopt.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h): Include conditionally; were previously
	included unconditionally.
	(man_getopt): Use setenv() if configure defined HAVE_SETENV; else use
	putenv(); previously used dedicated logic for specific platforms.

	* src/gripes.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdarg.h, stdlib.h): Include conditionally; were previously included
	unconditionally.
	(mantexts): Don't declare it when NONLS is in effect.

	* src/glob.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(config.h): Included by compat.h; don't care if SHELL defined.

	* src/util.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdarg.h, stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h): Include conditionally; were
	previously included unconditionally.
	(sys/stat.h, sys/types.h, sys/wait.h): Likewise.
	(man-config.h): Include unconditionally; previously not included.  It
	prototypes the getval() function, used to get the name of the SHELL,
	which _WIN32 will spawnlp() in system1().
	(winexec.h): Include it when configure says HAVE_PROCESS_H; it is a
	wrapper for process.h, to work around an argument parsing bug in
	Win32's spawnlp(), and similar functions.
	(mkprogname): Use win32posix() to avoid backslashes in Win32 style
	path names.
	(noprivileges): Don't call setreuid() or setregid() in _WIN32.
	(system1): Use spawnlp() rather than system(), in _WIN32, to invoke
	the man command pipeline.
	(my_system): Never use fork() in _WIN32; never run asynchronous _WIN32
	pipelines, therefore no need to call wait().
	(my_popen): FILE variable `r' unused in _WIN32; don't declare it.

	* src/winposix.c: New file; it defines the win32posix() function, used
	to replace backslashes with slashes, in Win32 path names.

2005-06-02  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.in (INCLUDES): Add "-I.".
	(top_srcdir): Correct definition, and...
	(msg.c, gripedefs.h): ...use it to locate msgs/mess.en.
	(man.c, glob.c): Use $(srcdir) to locate source.

2005-06-01  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Adaptation to autoconf configuration and build framework.

	* install-sh: New file;  autoconf generated configure requires it;
	source it from autoconf 2.59 distribution.

	* Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Add comments in file headers,
	to bring them up to a GPL conforming standard.
	Add standard autoconf path name substitutions; use them.
	(OBJEXT, EXEEXT): Added autoconf substitutions; use them.
	(VPATH): Defined to autoconf specified $(srcdir).

	* gencat/Makefile: Renamed...
	* gencat/Makefile.in: ...to this; need it so for VPATH support.

2005-05-31  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All files: Tagged MAN-1-5M2-AC; this is the starting point for
	autoconf managed implementation.

2005-05-31  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Switch to autoconf management of configure script.

	* All files: Tagged MAN-1-5M2-PRE-AC prior to switch.

	* configure.ac: New file; generated by autoscan; reorganised, and
	copyright notice added.

	* config.h.in: New file; generated by autoheader.

	* configure: Regenerated.

2005-05-31  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* man/it/makewhatis.8 ($Id$): make it match man-1.5m2 release.

2005-05-26  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Started recording ChangeLog entries.
	
	* ChangeLog: New file.

2005-05-26  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Initial import based on man-1.5m2 distribution.

	* All files (MAN-IMPORT): Tag assigned for `vendor' branch.
	(MAN-1-5M2-MINGW): Tag assigned for initial state of `trunk'.
