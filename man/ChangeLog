	autoconf substitution fields, to be filled out by configure; add space
	after initial `#', when key is occluded.
	(NOAUTOPATH, NOCACHE, MANDEFOPTIONS): Normally occluded; add space
	after occluding `#'.

	* src/Makefile.in (stamp.h): Add dependency on src/man.conf;

	* src/winposix.c: Removed...
	* src/win32/winposix.c: ...and relocated to here.

	* src/win32/wincmds.c: New file; it spawns a UNIXy shell to execute a
	specified command sequence.

	* src/win32/quotearg.c: New file; adapted from "groff" code, it
	ensures that all arguments passed in a Win32 spawn or exec function
	call are properly quoted; (Microsoft's default behaviour is broken).

	* src/win32/execvw.c: New file; compile it to generate a wrapper for
	the "spawnvp" function, which ensures that all arguments are properly
	quoted.

	* src/win32/execlw.c: New file; compile it to generate a wrapper for
	the "spawnlp" function, redirecting its action through the wrapped
	"spawnvp" function.

	* src/win32/getenvp.c: New file; included for completness, it is
	required by execlw.c, when generating wrapper functions which pass an
	explicit "envp" argument; it is not required by "man".

	* src/win32/winexec.h: New file; it transparently redirects all calls
	to Microsoft's spawn and exec functions through appropriate wrappers,
	to ensure proper argument quoting.

	* src/win32/Makefile.in: New file; processed by configure to generate
	Makefile, it defines the rules for building a library of Win32 wrapper
	functions.

	* src/Makefile.in (win32/libexec.a): New target; use it to build a
	Win32 support function library in src/win32.
	(WIN32LIBS): New variable; it specifies the support libraries to be

	modules to include in WIN32LIBEXEC.
	(FORCE): New dummy target; use it to force building of WIN32LIBEXEC.

	* src/compat.h (RUN_COMMAND_SEQUENCE): New macro; it invokes the
	"win32run_command_sequence" function to spawn commands on Win32
	platforms, or the "system" function otherwise.

	* src/util.c (system1): Use RUN_COMMAND_SEQUENCE macro.

	* configure.ac (process.h): Add check for header; it is required to
	use the Win32 spawn and exec functions.

	* configure: Regenerated.

2005-06-10  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Configure silent output capability for "grep" command.

	* aclocal.m4 (MAN_GREP_SILENT): New macro.
	(WIN32_AC_NULLDEV): New macro; MAN_GREP_SILENT uses it to identify the
	name of the null device, used for redirection of discarded output from
	grep; this should be `nul' for Win32, or `/dev/null' elsewhere.

	* configure.ac: Invoke MAN_GREP_SILENT.

	* configure: Regenerated.

	* src/Makefile.in (GREPSILENT): Correct quoting.

2005-06-09  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Add autoconf support for configuration file specification.

	* aclocal.m4: New file; it defines package specific autoconf macros.

	* configure.ac: Add specification for man configuration file; it is
	defined using the MAN_CONFIG_FILE macro, and optionally also the
	MAN_CONFIG_FILE_DEFAULT and MAN_CONFDIR_DEFAULT macros from
	aclocal.m4.

	* configure: Regenerated.

	* src/Makefile.in (INCLUDES): Pass them to $(CC) in $(DEFS).
	(stamp.h): New dummy target; use it to update paths.h.

2005-06-06  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/manpath.c (prmanpath): Use PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR; previously it
	always used ':' to separate MANPATH components.

2005-06-06  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	WinPOSIX bug fixes and API enhancements.

	* src/winposix (win32posix): Function renamed...
	(win32path_transform): ...to this.
	(win32path_is_absolute): New function; it checks if a specified Win32
	path name is absolute.

	* src/compat.h (isabspath): Macro renamed...
	(IS_ABSOLUTE_PATH): ...to this.
	(POSIX_STYLE_PATH): New macro; use it to invoke the
	win32path_transform function, when required.
	(PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR): Fix it, for non-Win32 hosts; had ';',
	should be ':'.

	* src/manpath.c: Use POSIX_STYLE_PATH and IS_ABSOLUTE_PATH macros.

	previously included in CFLAGS.
	(CFLAGS): Redefined; include $(CWARN), add -I$(top_builddir)/src
	(man2html): Make it depend on $(top_builddir)/src/version.h, rather
	than ../src/version.h.
	(hman): Locate hman.sh in $(srcdir).

	* man2html/man2html.c (version.h): Don't specify path.

2005-06-03  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/man.conf.in: Identify as PACKAGE_NAME-PACKAGE_VERSION.

	* man2html/Makefile.in (package, version): New identifiers; initialise
	them from PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION.

	* src/compat.h: New file; it defines platform specific dependencies
	for use within C compilation units.

	* src/makemsg.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, unistd.h, string.h): Include conditionally.

	* src/man.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(locale.h, stdlib.h, string.h, sys/file.h, sys/stat.h, unistd.h):
	Previously included unconditionally; make them conditional.
	(strings.h): Include conditionally, unless we already have string.h.
	(GREPSILENT): Change from single character definition to string;
	format it using "%s".  (Rationale: UNIX SysV grep can't use -q or -s
	to suppress output; must redirect to null device stream).
	(setlocale): Some platforms don't define LC_MESSAGES; don't use it
	when we don't have it.  Similarly for LC_CTYPE.

	* src/manpath.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, string.h, sys/types.h, sys/stat.h, unistd.h): Previously
	included unconditionally; make them conditional.
	(split, split2): Use win32posix() function to ensure that Win32 path
	names include only slashes, and no backslashes;
	Use PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR, defined in compat.h, to locate point at which
	to split a path list; previously these assumed splitting at a colon.
	(add_to_list): Use isabspath(dir) macro, defined in compat.h, to check
	if dir is specified with absolute path name; previously required first
	character to be a slash.

	* src/man-config.c, src/to_cat.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, string.h): Include conditionally; were previously included
	unconditionally.

	* src/man-getopt.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h): Include conditionally; were previously
	included unconditionally.
	(man_getopt): Use setenv() if configure defined HAVE_SETENV; else use
	putenv(); previously used dedicated logic for specific platforms.

	* src/gripes.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdarg.h, stdlib.h): Include conditionally; were previously included
	unconditionally.
	(mantexts): Don't declare it when NONLS is in effect.

	* src/glob.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(config.h): Included by compat.h; don't care if SHELL defined.

	* src/util.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdarg.h, stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h): Include conditionally; were
	previously included unconditionally.
	(sys/stat.h, sys/types.h, sys/wait.h): Likewise.
	(man-config.h): Include unconditionally; previously not included.  It
	prototypes the getval() function, used to get the name of the SHELL,
	which _WIN32 will spawnlp() in system1().
	(winexec.h): Include it when configure says HAVE_PROCESS_H; it is a
	wrapper for process.h, to work around an argument parsing bug in
	Win32's spawnlp(), and similar functions.
	(mkprogname): Use win32posix() to avoid backslashes in Win32 style
	path names.
	(noprivileges): Don't call setreuid() or setregid() in _WIN32.
	(system1): Use spawnlp() rather than system(), in _WIN32, to invoke
	the man command pipeline.
	(my_system): Never use fork() in _WIN32; never run asynchronous _WIN32
	pipelines, therefore no need to call wait().
	(my_popen): FILE variable `r' unused in _WIN32; don't declare it.

	* src/winposix.c: New file; it defines the win32posix() function, used
	to replace backslashes with slashes, in Win32 path names.

2005-06-02  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.in (INCLUDES): Add "-I.".
	(top_srcdir): Correct definition, and...
	(msg.c, gripedefs.h): ...use it to locate msgs/mess.en.
	(man.c, glob.c): Use $(srcdir) to locate source.

2005-06-01  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Adaptation to autoconf configuration and build framework.

	* install-sh: New file;  autoconf generated configure requires it;
	source it from autoconf 2.59 distribution.

	* Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Add comments in file headers,
	to bring them up to a GPL conforming standard.
	Add standard autoconf path name substitutions; use them.
	(OBJEXT, EXEEXT): Added autoconf substitutions; use them.
	(VPATH): Defined to autoconf specified $(srcdir).

	* gencat/Makefile: Renamed...
