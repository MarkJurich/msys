	the "spawnvp" function, which ensures that all arguments are properly
	quoted.

	* src/win32/execlw.c: New file; compile it to generate a wrapper for
	the "spawnlp" function, redirecting its action through the wrapped
	"spawnvp" function.

	(stdlib.h, unistd.h, string.h): Include conditionally.

	* src/man.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(locale.h, stdlib.h, string.h, sys/file.h, sys/stat.h, unistd.h):
	Previously included unconditionally; make them conditional.
	(strings.h): Include conditionally, unless we already have string.h.
	(GREPSILENT): Change from single character definition to string;
	format it using "%s".  (Rationale: UNIX SysV grep can't use -q or -s
	to suppress output; must redirect to null device stream).
	(setlocale): Some platforms don't define LC_MESSAGES; don't use it
	when we don't have it.  Similarly for LC_CTYPE.

	* src/manpath.c (compat.h): Include unconditionally.
	(stdlib.h, string.h, sys/types.h, sys/stat.h, unistd.h): Previously
	included unconditionally; make them conditional.
	(split, split2): Use win32posix() function to ensure that Win32 path
	names include only slashes, and no backslashes;
	Use PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR, defined in compat.h, to locate point at which
	to split a path list; previously these assumed splitting at a colon.
	(add_to_list): Use isabspath(dir) macro, defined in compat.h, to check
	if dir is specified with absolute path name; previously required first
	character to be a slash.

	unconditionally.

	previously included unconditionally.
	(sys/stat.h, sys/types.h, sys/wait.h): Likewise.
	(man-config.h): Include unconditionally; previously not included.  It
	prototypes the getval() function, used to get the name of the SHELL,
	which _WIN32 will spawnlp() in system1().
	(winexec.h): Include it when configure says HAVE_PROCESS_H; it is a
	wrapper for process.h, to work around an argument parsing bug in
	Win32's spawnlp(), and similar functions.
	(mkprogname): Use win32posix() to avoid backslashes in Win32 style
	path names.
	(noprivileges): Don't call setreuid() or setregid() in _WIN32.
	(system1): Use spawnlp() rather than system(), in _WIN32, to invoke
	the man command pipeline.
	(my_system): Never use fork() in _WIN32; never run asynchronous _WIN32
	pipelines, therefore no need to call wait().
