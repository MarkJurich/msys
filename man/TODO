Review support under HP-UX, Irix, Solaris, AIX, OS-X and other *NIXes - 
Currently looking at w32 and Cygwin submissions. Comments and patches welcome.

Improvements and reviews of internationalization/localization, 
French and Russian patches pending.

----> The localization and platform support issues will be addressed in the
next two minor releases. Contributions and comments in those areas are 
particularly appreciated.

]

hman does not use LANG

Are there known security problems in the present setup?
