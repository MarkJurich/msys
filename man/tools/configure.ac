# The `configure' script, generated from this template, provides a mechanism
# for configuring the `tools' directory for building native code tools, which
# may be required in a cross-compiling environment.  While it may be invoked
# `stand-alone', it is normally invoked indirectly, by the `configure' script
# at the top level;  in this case, the following settings are passed down
# from the top level configure:--
#
#    top level BUILD_CC is propagated to `tools' CC
#    top level BUILD_CFLAGS is propagated to `tools' CFLAGS
#    top level BUILD_LDFLAGS is propagated to `tools' LDFLAGS
#    top level BUILD_CPPFLAGS is propagated to `tools' CPPFLAGS

#
# Identify the C compiler...
# Since the top level `configure' doesn't propagate its `build_alias' or
# `host_alias' settings, this should be a native code compiler, even when the
# top level `configure' specifies cross-compiling.
