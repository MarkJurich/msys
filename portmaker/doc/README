	    MinGW PORTMAKER - The mingwPORT template compiler

Portmaker provides a means to create a standardized release for the mingwPORT
packages.  A developer uses portmaker to create the files necessary to download,
configure, make, install and cleanup the users desired source.  The portmaker
package, processes templates from the template directory to the desired location
you wish to create the mingwPORT depot directory.

To operate portmaker for this release, notice that it may change as we are in
early development of this package, you simply answer questions at the MSYS
shell as prompted and files will be delivered to your desired location.
Remember that you are answering questions as they relate to the build of other
shell files.  Typically the default is the correct answer once you answer
the first two questions.  Give the newly created mingwPORT a try to discover if
you need to do any patching. If you have patches then you will deliver those 
patches in the mingwPORT directory with a name of mingwPORT.patch.

Processing of the patch can be controlled by the mingwPORT.beforepatch file.
Processing after the patch can also be done with a mingwPORT.afterpatch file.
These files are not typical so they will not be delivered automatically.
