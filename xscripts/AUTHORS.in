.LP
This `x86-mingw32-build' script package was written for the MinGW Project
by Keith Marshall <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>.
.LP
The cross compiler build strategy has been derived from an earlier script,
originally written by Paul Millar <paulm@astro.gla.ac.uk>,
and based on information provided by Pieter Thysebaert;
this was subsequently modified by Heiko Gerdau <hg@technosis.de>,
and by Keith Marshall,
and maintained by Michael Gerdau <mgd@technosis.de>.
.LP
The modular structure,
and the interactive features of the present script have been adapted from
the `portmaker' package,
also written for the Mingw Project,
by Earnie Boyd <earnie@users.sourceforge.net> and Keith Marshall.
