	Improve efficiency of GCC build; add more comments.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh: Add miscellaneous comments.
	(GCC_LANGUAGE_SET): Enable all in STAGE 1 configuration.
	(ALL_GCC, INSTALL_GCC): New shell variables; define them; use when...
	[COMPONENT == gcc, STAGE == 1]: ...to facilite once-only configuration
	with all languages selected, while still building only the C compiler;
	reset at end of STAGE 1, to enable remaining languages in STAGE 2.

2009-02-22  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Add diagnostic for invalid DOWNLOAD_HOST.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.mirrors: Emit diagnostic message, in
	`unattended' build mode, when `$DOWNLOAD_HOST' does not specify a
	valid mirror, and downloads are enabled.

2009-02-22  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Add support for new MinGW.org package naming conventions.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh (MINGWRT): New shell variable; define it
	as the requisite package base name for `mingw-runtime' or `mingwrt',
	which is determined by new `tarname' function; use it to resolve all
	subsequent references to the `mingw-runtime' package.
	(COMPONENT) [mingw-runtime]: Make it match `$MINGWRT'; build it for
	whatever package base name that may be specified thereby.
	(LEAN_BUILD) [isyes]: Purge all plausible `$MINGWRT' aliases.
	(TARGET_OS): New shell variable; define it.
	(TARGET): Use it.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.functions (tarname): New function; it
	identifies possible alternative source package names, including the
	`mingwrt' vs. `mingw-runtime' distinction, and names qualified by
	`$TARGET_OS' preceding the `src' suffix.
	(enumerate): Include such package names, qualified by `$TARGET_OS'.
	(choose): Use both of above, to display available package choices.
	(incr, space): Simplify implementation, to avoid error messages.
	(prepare): Accommodate `$TARGET_OS' qualified package names.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.batch (select_newest): New locally defined
	function; use it to facilitate package version selection when...
	(USE_LATEST_VERSIONS) [isyes]: ...this is true.
	(gcc_srctag, binutils_srctag, mingwrt_srctag, w32api_srctag): New
	optionally defined shell variables; define as required; use them in
	all package name references, with default value of "src".
	(mingwrt): New shell variable; define it locally; use it as an
	analogue of `$MINGWRT'.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.dialogue (tarname): Use as appropriate.
	(gcc_srctag, binutils_srctag, mingwrt_srctag, w32api_srctag): New
	optionally defined shell variables; define and use them in same manner
	as they are used in `x86-mingw32-build.sh.batch'.
	(mingwrt): New shell variable; define and use it in same manner as it
	is used in `x86-mingw32-build.sh.batch'.

2009-02-21  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Enable `sysroot' for binutils.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh (COMPONENT) [binutils]: Add `--with-sysroot'
	option, when running `configure', placing the `sysroot' at...
	(INSTALL_DIR): ...this path assignment.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.conf (BUILD_COMPONENTS): Reschedule...
	(headers): ...this as first component for installation, ahead of...
	(binutils): ...this, which now needs the headers to be pre-installed
	in the designated `sysroot' path, before it is built.

2009-02-19  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fix MinGW-Bug[2031691]: Dry run may break subsequent build.
	(Reported by Dave Korn <davek_cygwin@users.sourceforge.net>)

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh (setbuilddir): Guard all usage with `$RUN'.
	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.getopts [--dry-run] (BUILD_PLATFORM):
	Pre-define; avoid invocation of `config.guess' at point of use.

2009-02-18  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Relocate GDC support to experimental development branch; phase 2.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh: Revert GDC specific changes from 2008-01-13.
